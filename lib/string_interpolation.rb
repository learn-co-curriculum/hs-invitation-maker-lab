# Instead of using .gsub, let's use string interpolation to change the content of the invitation. 
# Set Percy's name, the day 'Saturday', the '22nd', and the year to be variables instead. 
# Change the value of these variables to reflect Ron's info, he plans to have his party on May 18th, 1997 (Sunday).
# Finally, print Ron's version of the invitation so he can copy it from his console.
