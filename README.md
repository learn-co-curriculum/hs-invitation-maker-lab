# String Manipulation



For this section, you'll need to print integers to the console so let's go over that sytax real fast. Say you have 6 apples, `num_of_apples = 6`, and you have two options for printing this info out:

1. puts "I have " + num_of_apples.to_s + " apples."
2. puts "I have #{num_of_apples} apples."
